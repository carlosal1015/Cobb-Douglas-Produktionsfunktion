# The Ramsey Model:
# =================
# 
# In the previous lab, we learned how to simulate a deterministic, discrete time version of the Solow growth model where the savings rate of the economy was taken to be exogenous.  In this lab, we will learn how to solve and simulate a deteministic, discrete time version of the Ramsey model where the savings rate is endogenously chosen optimally by the representative household.  Although the Ramsey model is being presented after the Solow model (primarily because it involves optimizing on the parts of houeholds which makes the model technically more "sophisticated"), the optimization bits of the Ramsey model intellectually predate the Solow model by almost 30 years! Also, unlike the Solow model which was designed to be a decriptive model of economic growth, the Ramsey model was originally designed to be a normative, mathematical solution to the problem of how to optimal choose the savings rate for a society.  
# 
# I highly recommend that you take a glance through [Frank Ramsey's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_P._Ramsey) original paper, entitled [A Mathematical Theory of Saving](http://folk.uio.no/gasheim/zRam1928.pdf).  In particular the introduction where Ramsey states that the common practice amongst economists and decision theorists of discounting the future was "ethicially indefensible and arises mearly from the weakness of the imagination."  Ramsey leaves little doubt that his paper was normative and not positive in character.  Finally, there is not a single citation at the end of Ramsey's paper: he simply signed his name!  Apparently, for this model at least, Ramsey owed no intellectial debts.

# Task 1: Get to know your utility function!
# ------------------------------------------
# 
# In this task you will plot the representative agent's utility function:
# 
# $$u(C) = \frac{C^{1 - \theta} - 1}{1 - \theta}$$
# 
# The Ramsey model assumes that the representative individual has CRRA utility.  Individual utility is a function of consumption per person, C. The parameter,  $0 \lt \theta$, plays a dual role:
# 
# * $\theta$ is the agent's coefficient of relative risk aversion
# * $\frac{1}{\theta}$ is the agent's elasticity of inter-temporal substitution
# Things to consider:
# 
# When $0 \lt \theta$ but "close" to zero, consumer has almost linear (i.e., risk neutral) utility. As $\theta$ increases, households becomes more risk averse (i.e., the curvature of the utility function increases!). Note that this increase in curvature becomes most apparent in the behavior of the utility function for levels of consumption less than 1. As $\theta$ increase the "penalty" for consuming less than 1 unit becomes increasingly severe!
# 
# Why is there a '-1' in the numerator come from? It has the effect of making total utility positive or negative depending on whether C is greater than or less than one. Also 
# 
# $$\lim_{\theta \rightarrow 1}\ \frac{C^{1 - \theta} - 1}{1 - \theta}\ =\ \mathrm{ln}\ C$$.

# To see what the above preferences imply about the representative agent's optimal choices for consumption today and consumption tomorrow, suppose the can work for a representative firm and earn labor income $W_{1}$ today and $W_{2}$ tomorrow (note that we are assuming that agent's labor endowment is normalized to unity, and that agent supplies his entire labor endowment in both periods). These assumptions imply that the houshold budget constraint is
# 
# $$C_{1} + \frac{1}{1 + r_{1}}C_{2} = W_{1} + \frac{1}{1 + r_{1}}W_{2}$$ 
# 
# To find optimal consumption bundle, set up the Lagrangian: $$\max_{C_{1},C_{2}}\ \frac{C_{1}^{1 - \theta} - 1}{1 - \theta} + e^{-\rho}\left(\frac{C_{2}^{1 - \theta} - 1}{1 - \theta}\right) + \lambda\left[W_{1} + \frac{1}{1 + r_{1}}W_{2} - C_{1} - \frac{1}{1 + r_{1}}C_{2}\right]$$

# 
# $$C_{1}^{-\theta} - \lambda = 0$$

# 
# $$C_{1} + \frac{1}{1 + r_{1}}C_{2} = W_{1} + \frac{1}{1 + r_{1}}W_{2}$$

# One can reduce the above to a 2 equation non-linear system in 2 unkowns by eliminating $\lambda$:
# 
# $$C_{1}^{-\theta} = e^{-\rho}(1 + r_{1})C_{2}^{-\theta}$$
# 
# $$C_{1} + \frac{1}{1 + r_{1}}C_{2} = W_{1} + \frac{1}{1 + r_{1}}W_{2}$$

# Task 5: Stability and Dynamics
# ------------------------------
# 
# In this task you will learn how to simulate the deterministic Ramsey model and analyze the stability properties of a two-dimensional system.  Assessing dynamic stability of the Ramsey model is slightly more involved than was the case with the Solow model. Fundamentally, the reason is that the Ramsey model is defined by the equations **capital(k, c)** and **euler(k, c)** (i.e., a system of two equations in two unknowns) whereas the Solow model had only a single equation with one unknown.
# 
# However, the mathematics used to assess dynamic stability of the Ramsey model generalize quite nicely to larger models. To check dynamic stability, we need to:
# 
# 1. Construct a matrix of partial derivatives (i.e., the Jacobian). Unlike the Solow model, where by hand differentiation was not that hard, computing the partial derivatives for the Ramsey model is extremely tedious. However, in the Solow Lab you learned how to get Python to differentiate functions for you, so no need to bother with hand calculations!
# 2. Evaluate the partial derivatives at the steady-state values k_Star and c_Star
# 3. Calculate the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix.
# 
# Stability implies that the number of eigenvalues greater than 1 match the number of jump (or forward looking or control or choice) variables. In the Ramsey model there is one forward-looking variable: consumption per effective worker, c; and one backward-looking variable capital stock per effective worker, k. Thus we expect to find a single eigenvalue greater than 1!
# 
# Just to reinforce the usefulness of numerical/symbolic differentiation as a solution to these types of problems, we will compute and evaluate the partial derivatives in three ways 1) by-hand, 2) symbolically using Python, and 3) numerically using Python.

# Task 7: 'Forward Shooting' to find global non-linear saddle path of the Ramsey Model.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# In the previous task, you found a linear approximation to the optimal consumption savings deicison rule of the representative household in the neighborhood of the steady state.  In this task, we will show you how to solve for the full non-linear optimal consumption/savings decision rule (i.e., in your textbook this is referred to as the saddle-path of the Ramsey economy)!
# 
# Rough idea behind the 'forward shooting' algorithm: taking an initial level of capital stock per effective worker as given, the objective is to choose an initial level of consumption consistent with the saddle-path.
# 
# 1. Guess at the correct value for consumption (note that our initial guess must be feasible, implying that $0 \lt c_{0} \lt f(k_{0})$)
# 2. Iterate the economy forward through time and see if we arrive at the steady-state. If the level of consumption ever rises higher than steady-state consumption, then our initial choice of consumption was too high and we need to revise our guess downward. Similarly, if the level of capital stock per effective worker ever rises above its steady-state level, then our initial choice of consumption must have been too low and we need to revise our guess upward. 
# 3. Repeat this 'guess and check' procedure many times until will converge on a choice of consumption per effective worker than will get us 'close enough' (i.e., within our choice of error tolerance) to the steady state.
# 
# It is worth noting that the "forward-shooting" solution method can be used to solve any deterministic/perfect foresight model, including the Credit Cycles model of Kiyotaki and Moore (1997).
# 
# Why do we need to find the global solution? Why is the linear solution unsatisfactory? Linear approximation of decision rules on valid within some 'neighborhood' of the steady-state.  Just how large is this neighborhood? 
# 
# We can see that using the linear approximation initial value for consumption is not exactly the value that works with the full, non-linear model (the approximation will be increasingly accurate as $k_{0} \rightarrow k^{*}$ though).  How bad is the linear approximation?  No way to know unless one can find a method to solve for the full non-linear solution!
